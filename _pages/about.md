I am a Computer Science M.Sc. student at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) and part of the Privacy, Learning, Usability, and Security ([PLUS](https://plus-tau.github.io/)) research group, advised by [Dr. Mahmood Sharif](https://mahmoods01.github.io/).

I work at the intersection of computer security and machine learning. I’m interested in using ML for security and in the security of ML systems, from understanding vulnerability mechanisms to studying how they show up in real implementations such as retrieval and tool-using LLM schemes. 


## Education

**M.Sc. in Computer Science**, Tel Aviv University  (expected April, 2026)  
Advised by Dr. Mahmood Sharif

**B.Sc. in Computer Science**, Tel Aviv University

## Projects

##### Security-Incident Prediction from Text and Network Measurements (M.Sc. Thesis — submitting soon)
My M.Sc. thesis studies how public signals—geopolitical text and Internet-wide measurements—can be used to forecast organization-level security incidents at a fixed horizon. I focus on end-to-end evaluation under realistic constraints and on the systems work needed to make such pipelines scalable.

##### ccnews2024plus: Extending CC-News Beyond June 2024 (Dataset)
I released a cleaned extension of the CC-News Common Crawl corpus that continues the work started by [stanford-oval/ccnews] (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-oval/ccnews). The dataset extends coverage beyond June 2024 and applies filtering and deduplication using [DataTrove](https://github.com/huggingface/datatrove).

##### advEGI: Analyzing Transferability in Ego-Graph Information Maximization
Machine Learning with Graphs Course project analyzing transferability behavior in the [EGI](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/0dd6049f5fa537d41753be6d37859430-Paper.pdf) (NeurIPS 2021). I implemented PGD-style adversarial training to probe whether adversarial pretraining makes transfer more stable across domains, and evaluated its impact under controlled settings.
