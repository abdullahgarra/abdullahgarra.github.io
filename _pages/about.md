I am a Computer Science M.Sc. student at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) and part of the Privacy, Learning, Usability, and Security ([PLUS](https://plus-tau.github.io/)) research group, advised by [Dr. Mahmood Sharif](https://mahmoods01.github.io/).

I work at the intersection of computer security and machine learning. I’m interested in using ML for security and in the security of ML systems, from understanding vulnerability mechanisms to studying how they show up in real implementations such as retrieval and tool-using LLM schemes.
